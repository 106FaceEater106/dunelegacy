# How to build+run on OSX

This is tested with XCode 8.1 on Sierra.

```
git clone https://github.com/philippkeller/dunelegacy.git 
cd dunelegacy/IDE/xCode
mkdir -p ~/Library/Frameworks/
cp -rp SDL2.framework ~/Library/Frameworks/
cp -rp SDL2_mixer.framework ~/Library/Frameworks/
open Dune\ Legacy.xcodeproj
```

Building (Shift-âŒ˜-R) should work out of the box

## Run

First, download the original game (abandonware) [here](http://www.abandonwaredos.com/abandonware-game.php?abandonware=Dune+II%3A+The+building+of+a+dynasty&gid=1854)

```
cp ~/Downloads/Dune_II_The_Building_Of_A_Dynasty/*.pak ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dune\ Legacy/data/
cp data/*.PAK ~/Library/Application\ Support/Dune\ Legacy/data/ # this is from within the dunelegacy dir
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Dune_Legacy-..../Build/Products/Debug/Dune Legacy.app # see path when you click on "Dune Legacy.app" bottom left
```

You can also clone from the original git repo. Chances are that I cannot keep up with this repo -> you're better served by cloning from the [original sourceforge repo](git://git.code.sf.net/p/dunelegacy/code dunelegacy-code). The howto above should work as well.
